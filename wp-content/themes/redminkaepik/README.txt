<strong>FEATURED IMAGES</strong>
By default WordPress will create a default thumbnail image for each image you upload and the size can be specified in your dashboard under Settings > Media. In addition, the Epik theme creates the following thumbnail images you'll see below, which are defined (and can be modified) in the functions.php file. These are the recommended thumbnail sizes that are used on the Epik theme demo site.

featured-img - 630 by 320
featured-page - 276px by 140px
portfolio-thumbnail - 264px by 200px

<strong>SLIDESHOW</strong>
The slider that is underneath the header/navigation in the demo was created with the Genesis Responsive Slider plugin. This can be downloaded at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/genesis-responsive-slider. Upload the Genesis Responsive Slider folder via FTP to your wp-content/plugins/ directory and then activate it. You will also need to configure the plugin by going to the Plugins > Genesis Responsive Slider page in your dashboard. This is a widgeted area, so you can use any slider or content you want within this space.
